## Meiosis/Mitosis Simulation â€” Unity Code

This repository contains the core Unity C# scripts used for the "Meiosis/Mitosis Simulation" educational project. The simulation helps students learn about chromosome division, differences between parental chromosome sets, and how these differences affect genetic outcomes in offspring.

## ðŸ§© Key Features of the Code:

- 3D cell model integration created in Blender.

- Custom liquid shader (Shader Graph & HLSL) for realistic visualization of cytoplasmic fluid.

- Interactive learning scenarios where students select chromosomes from mother and father and observe inheritance outcomes.

- Dynamic cycle demonstration of meiosis phases.

- Scriptable architecture for flexible configuration of logic steps.

- Sprite-based optimizations to reduce build size and improve WebGL performance.

- Localization support (English, Hebrew, Arabic).

- Integration with external TypeScript API using System.Runtime.InteropServices for real-time parameter adjustments.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

- Unity 2021.3.30 (LTS)

- C#

- TextMeshPro for high-quality text rendering

- Blender (for 3D models)

- Custom shaders (Shader Graph & HLSL)

- WebGL for browser deployment

## ðŸ“‚ Note

This repository contains only Unity scripts and core logic. The full simulation with assets and deployment resources is part of a private repository.
